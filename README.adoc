= Couchbase Release Notes Builder

:experimental:

== Introduction

Creating release notes from Jira issues is pretty dull, AmIRight?

Each module's release note is in a different format, and you need a different Jira search to find the ones that go in the notes (and don't forget to filter out the private ones).

[#cb-release-notes-image]
.cb_release_notes is off and running!
image::cb-release-note-run.png[]
Well, the boffins in the docs team have put together a small Python script to take some of the tedium out building release notes.

WARNING: This isn't going to do the whole thing automatically, but we're aiming to cover the dull bits of the process. +
After generating the release notes, make sure you look through them to make sure they are correct!

== Installation

The script and its associated libraries are packaged as single executable.

. Download `package.zip` from https://github.com/RayOffiah/cb-release-notes/releases and unpack it into a spare directory.
. Your directory set up should look something like this:
+
[source, text]
----
ðŸ“‚
  ðŸ“„ cb_release_notes              <.>
  ðŸ“„ cb_release_notes_config.yml   <.>
  ðŸ“‚ templates
    ðŸ“„ couchbase-mobile.jinja2     <.>
    ðŸ“„ couchbase-docs-server.jinja2
----
<.> The application
<.> The application's configuration file.
<.> A template for generating the AsciiDoc release note.
+
NOTE: The location of the templates can be specified in `cb_release_notes_config.yaml`.


== Configuration
Release notes are created from a `release set` specified in the configuration file:

[source, yaml]
----
# Configuration file for the release notes builder

password_file: ./.passwords.yaml #<.>

<.> The version of the application.
This is just to help keep track of things.
<.> The location of the passwords file. URLS in the `release-settings` require a username/password or a token for access. These are stored in a separate file keyed to the URL:
+
[source, yaml]
----
https://issues.couchbase.com:
  username: fred.smith
  password: fancypants120

https://atlassian.couchbase.com:
  token: HUFGHitha354HHFHAPLKHJ
----
<.> The location of the `Jinja2` templates used to render the release notes.
<.> Marks the beginning of a release set. When the program runs, you will be presented with a list of release sets (see xref:cb-release-notes-image[xrefstyle=short]) to pick from.
<.> The URL for the issue database.
+
IMPORTANT: The URL is used as the key for the password file.Make sure that the entries match up exactly.
<.> The JQL statement used to retrieve the Jiras making up the release note.
You can use macros variables (`+{{variable_name}}+`) inside the JQL, which will need to be filled in when the generator runs.
+
TIP: Every release set should, at the very least, require the user to enter a release number.
(However, we've chosen not to make this compulsory.)


<.> A lot of Jiras are not meant for public consumption, so it's a good idea to check that the Jiras included in the release note are marked for public consumption.

<.> The 'fields' section is a list of fields that the program will ask for.
The user will fill in the entries, and the value will be stored under the given name (`release_number` for example).
The fields can be referenced in the `jql` statement and/or the `jinja` template.
The program  supports five field types:
[horizontal]
text:: An arbitrary field of text.
multiline:: The same as text, except you can enter multiple lines.
editor:: This will open your system editor for editing large wodges of text.
+
WARNING: This one is experimental; we recommend you don't use it in production.

select:: A menu selection from which the user can select a single value.
choice:: A multiple choice selection.
+

<.> The template that will be used to render the release note.

For more information on `Jinja2` templates, see the https://jinja.palletsprojects.com[Jinja Documentation]

== Running the program

The program is a Python script packaged as an executable (hence the size!)
Run it from the shell:
[source, shell]
----
./cb_release_note
----

And follow the instructions.

[NOTE]
.Running on Macs
====
You may run into difficulty running the application on Mac
due to Apple's GateKeeper security setup.

If you receive an error stating that the application is untrusted,
then go to `System Settings` and click on the menu:Privacy & Security[] menu item.
From there, go to menu:Security[Allow Applications from].
Make sure that this is set to `App Store & Known Developers`.
====





Now copy the generated file to the `partials` directory of the module under release.
Then `include::` the file at the top of the existing release note.

== Developing and Building

You will need a Python environment.
The following should be a minimal way to build the script.

[source, shell]
----
brew install pyenv  # will install the whole world

pyenv init
# NOW copy/paste the suggested code into your .zshrc, and restart your shell session

# replace with the current stable Python version number from https://www.python.org/downloads/
pyenv install 3.13.3

pyenv shell 3.13.3  # this points Python to the installed version just for THIS shell session

pip install -r requirements.txt

./packager.sh
# creates package/ and zips it up into package.zip

./package/cb-release-note

TODO: document how to create a new Release on Github.
